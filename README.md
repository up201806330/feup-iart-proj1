## Get this project

### Setup

On Microsoft Windows, (as always) things don't just work out-of-the-box.

This project uses ASCII color codes, which are not enabled on some versions of Windows by default.

#### cmd/PowerShell

If colors don't properly render, try running the following command in cmd as administrator so that cmd can correctly interpret ASCII colors ([source](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/5255355/How-to-Put-Color-on-Windows-Console)):
```cmd
reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001 /f
```
and open a new cmd (not required to be administrator) to run with correct color rendering. Worked for me on Windows 10.

#### Visual Studio Code integrated terminal (cmd/PowerShell)

Add the following line to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
"terminal.integrated.windowsEnableConpty": false
```
and open a new integrated terminal to run with correct color rendering and avoid garbage being printed.

### Compile

This project uses CMake, to compile the project run
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

The executable is called `main` and will be placed in the root of the repository.

To run it in interactive mode, just run `./main`; for the CLI mode, run `./main cli` to check the possible options.
